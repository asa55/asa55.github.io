I realize to an extent experts should "stay in their lane". My expertise is in engineering, but my interests include almost everything. I may comment on lots of topics here where you could rightly question my authority to make such claims, and with that in mind I will attempt to expose my line of reasoning openly enough that you can attack my premises rather than perceptions of my expertise.

## Musings on Whether or Not P = NP

<details>

</summary>

If you ask [the profs of MIT 6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/), any sane person would conjecture that P does not equal NP... So take my thoughts on this with a grain of salt.

In the 2015 version of MIT 6.006 posted online, Dr. Eric comments that saying [P=NP](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm) discussed the importance of analogous problems, so that if we can reduce a problem of interest to us into an identical formulation as one that has already been solved, then our original problem is also solved. Then, with regards to the question of whether or not P = NP, he said this must be absurt because it is equivalent to the conjecture that we can construct some magical computing equipment that can pick the right guess on the first try every time. A "magic box", of sorts.

Now here's where I might be crazy - but isn't this exactly what quantum computers are doing? All answers are true and false simultaneously and the right answer is returned in a single operation. As I recall, this is the key advantage of quantum computing. So if that's the case, didn't we build the "magic box" to which Eric refers? This leads me to the conjecture that if we can prove that P = NP is identical to the "magic box" problem, then we'll prove that (counterintuitively, and literally a million-dollar problem) P = NP.

## On Motivation and Mastery

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

I've always been interested in what it takes to be proficient or expert in a topic. I found recently that "expert" is really just media-speak without well-defined meaning, but that aside we can improve our relative proficiency to be better than we were before, and we can measure that performance to verify our progress.

A few years ago, I read [The 4 Hour Work Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUTDhLPpP9o) by Tim Ferriss. At the outset of my career, it posed a very refreshing look at how life might shake out given various career approaches in addition to the standard Nine-to-Five. I'm less interested in doing one thing extremely well than I am in doing many things very well. To that end, I really loved the [TED Talk on The First 20 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), which details the art of deconstruction and attaining some degree of mastery. I'm not sure if it's backed by unbiased research other than that of the presenter, but it certainly sounds good and there is merit to the 80/20 principle.

Josh Kaufman states that to learn:

* Decide exactly what you want to be able to do
* Get far enough along that you can start learning and self-correct
   * Definitely don't say "I'm going to read all these things first" - that's procrastination
* Remove barriers to practice, as this increases the likelihood of success

The first two points agree with some key takeaways from  [Turn the Ship Around](https://ti-pdf-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a2db0dfc-5ef0-4885-bc3c-d7ff27972c4a/pdf_output/English/118723063.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIQBOMCVUHTOT3DFQ&Expires=1578866811&Signature=bl7t0S78p%2B7qT6gf74dq6sak3Fg%3D) by David Marquet, and these points definitely satisfy all the requirements of motivation that you'll read elsewhere. Structure your living quarters to make things you want to do easier to do, and things you should avoid doing even harder to do. Example: if you want to watch less TV, don't have one in every room.

It's definitely all about practice. The question is "how much", and the answer in all cases is to deconstruct the task into simpler tasks, then practice those simpler tasks. You'll know how much to practice each element once you've deconstructed it into bite-sized chunks.

Here's an example: if you want to be a better storyteller, document stories you already know, catalogue them by effect (the one you intend for the audience), then practice each story and memorize the associated effect for that story. In the future when you want to tell a story that conveys a feeling or a certain message to an audience (say you're holding a meeting at work), you've already mastered the mechanics of telling the story and you know which ones are applicable - so just pull the canned story out of your mental library and go. You will instantly be perceived as a better storyteller.

Here's another example: you shouldn't "save articles for later" no matter how cool, interesting, or tempting. If you don't have the motivation or interest to read it right now, or if you don't have a specific time in mind as to when you'll get around to reading it, you're better off not letting it clutter up your bookmarks/favorites/open tabs in your browser. The reason for this is that there are lots of great things to read, and you'll find them all the time. Your curiosity will lead you to them at the appropriate times, and there is no reason to let yourself get overwhelmed by all the blog or book recommendations you made to your future-self. Read them or delete them - you will feel more free if you're anything like me.

So when it comes to motivation:

1. Have a reason
2. Visualize your goal
3. Have a plan
4. Take small steps
5. Don't compare yourself to others
6. Do not procrastinate
7. Previous mistakes are just test results that can be used to help you learn

But don't take my word for it - a closing note on mastery that I love to keep in mind when it comes to "internet research" (anything I want to know more about that's not the topic of formally peer-reviewed research), one thing I love to do is to search a topic on Google, ctrl+click (or command+click on Mac) all of the first 3 pages of Google results (which opens a new tab for each page in your browser) then search with different wording a few times and do the same thing until I have dozens of tabs open from various sources. Many results are dead-links or just poorly written, so once you close out all but the quality results, you'll find you can count on one hand the number of open tabs remaining. Then you can read those thoroughly. For any topic you can imagine, there is a ton of great content out there, and it can be hard to filter through the noise. This is how I attempt to, and is exactly how I learned a variety of technical topics and even topics I'm relaying here on this blog.

## On Life Goals

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

Realize that at this point in my life I have a stable job, a Master's degree, an apartment, a fiancee, a dog, and while there are clearly more major life goals to accomplish, my notions of what I feel are important are vastly different than when (for example) I was graduating high school and had high ambition but low circumstantial stability. Based on this, I have every reason to believe that my perspectives and values will change again over time.

I find currently that my objectives are dominated by sustaining day-to-day stability as my fiancee and I try to maintain a positive trajectory for ourselves and our small family. (I don't think I should put that last word in quotes here because it's really a family, just not the house-and-kids kind).

With that context in mind, I started by accepting the fact that the finite-lifetime-phenomenon (as my friend and mentor Dr. Christopher Taudt over in Germany likes to call it) is very real. I can't do it all, though not for lack of trying. My typical mode of operation is to pick one thing, and work on it obsessively until I have achieved my mission, then go onto the next thing. It's like taking single-tasking to an extreme. I love getting entirely absorbed in what I'm working on. But I realize that this approach is an ideal that I can't sustain now that there are many battles I need to fight on a day-to-day basis, and I would rather keep all of these goals healthy rather than excel beyond all reason in a single one of them while others fall apart.

I started by going through many lists of adjectives that I wanted to consider myself, work towards, or be described as by others. The list I came up with included:

* Handsome
* Healthy
* Strong
* Stylish
* Creative
* Smart
* Present
* Sociable
* Positive
* Witty
* Worldly
* Interesting
* Organized
* Confident
* Dependable
* Adept
* Entrepreneurial
* Mature

Some of these are shallow and ill-defined. That's okay, because the goal is to make myself feel as though I'm moving in what I consider to be a better direction as a person, a finace, an employee, and other areas relevant to my own life.

So the next thing to do is to map these objectives to things I can do that I perceive will move me closer to attaining these goals. Of course, the mapping I come up with is hardly scientific - though in the case of being mentally present and being positive, there is some research demonstrating the means selected will move me closer to my desired end.

This isn't unlike an approach Ben Franklin used when he wanted to improve his behavior. He kept a pocket notebook where he would evaluate how well he upheld his goals that day / week. My method is slightly different, where I work on specific tasks according to a schedule I've set for myself. These tasks are:

* Handsome --> Groom regularly
* Healthy --> Watch my diet
* Strong --> Exercise regularly
* Stylish --> Maintain wardrobe
* Creative --> Work on projects
* Smart --> Study regularly
* Present --> Meditate regularly (check out the Headspace app before you judge me on this please!)
* Sociable --> Participate in events
* Positive --> Gratitude journal
* Witty --> Practice jokes (look up humor simplified & demystified)
* Worldly --> Stay approximately up to date on some pop-culture and news topics
* Interesting --> Practice speaking with emphasis
* Organized --> Tidy up regularly (at home and at work)
* Confident --> Practice posture
* Dependable --> Keep going to work
* Adept --> Methodically approach new skills
* Entrepreneurial --> Maintain participation in small business interests
* Mature --> Don't judge, accept myself and others as we are today, recognize that I don't "know it all", be willing to change and welcome criticism, eliminate addictions (in my case, the habit of single-tasking), say no to myself and to others without hesitation, set goals, get to work, move forward, embrace self discipline, avoid complaining

I was able to schedule each of these tasks into a small weekly calendar. The calendar only lists the actions I intend to take, but I like to keep in mind that I am doing these things with more abstract goals in mind. I realize that I can't always keep the regularity in my schedule that I'd like, but I try to stay on track and it's okay if I falter some days. In addition, these objectives don't occupy my entire day, so there's plenty of room for me to do other things (like playing video games or taking the car to the shop or other emergent tasks). Lastly and most importantly I embrace optimistic nihilism (discussed in another post), so none of this makes me better or more whole than I would be if I didn't do it. I just want to do these things, mainly because I found over the course of my life so far that these types of tasks tend to result in me feeling happier. And that's more than enough reason to pursue them.

## On Entrepreneurship and Small Business

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

I have tried a myriad of things to succeed in small business. It is extremely difficult. For a little bit of context, I have always considered myself a risk taker, technically competent, quick to learn, and all of the things that I assumed would make for a great entrepreneur. As of the time of this writing, I've made more money on lemonade sales as a kid than I have in any of my side gigs as an adult. Granted, my mom got me down to the strip district on weekends in the city of Pittsburgh where my little stand was pulling in over thirty bucks an hour after accounting for the cost of materials. Not bad for a snot-nosed kid, I think. I sold items on eBay, on Amazon, opened a stock trading account with ScotTrade for my mom (who never had traded stocks herself) and tinkered around with a thousand bucks I saved up in quarters up to age 16. These were all of the hallmarks of an entrepreneur, I believed.

But I got through my technical training in college and went into an engineering career, expecting that this would prepare me for the world of taking my product development ambitions solo and making a living through my own business. Everyone will tell you that the world is primed for people like this, and that you're writing your own check. I can attest to the fact that it's not that easy - not at all.

Circa 2018, I opened my first LLC, the Stronghold Homes Company. The aim of this business was to use a drop-shipping model to middle-man sales of home security equipment until I built up enough cash flow to invest in developing custom products of my own making. Even though I had a great brand and a document trail out the door for all the businesses that were willing to drop-ship on my company's behalf, and even though I had hundreds of products available on my website ranging from Tasers to pocket knives to bear spray, the business didn't come. I discovered the notion that "if you build it, they will come" does not apply on the internet. It is a vast ocean of data that, unlike my lemonade stand on prime real-estate in the city, simply didn't have the visibility. I didn't have the cash to invest in serious advertising outside of Google AdWords, and I didn't have the confidence that I could run the race to the bottom with other companies drop-shipping the same goods, and in two-days on Amazon no less. A trusted website where people don't hesitate to part with credit card information (for good reason, by the way). I realized that I would need to fight tooth and nail to get sales going for a smattering of other people's products I wasn't passionate about, and that there was no telling if I'd ever have the means to develop my own custom products. So I backed out and dissolved the company at the end of the year.

The following year, 2019, was the year I turned to software. After learning my lesson in supply-chain management in the previous annum, I realized that if I could develop products in which I could control the distribution, then the options were limitless in terms of what I could sell at the outset. I have formal training in software development and even work experience in it. But it is difficult to bootstrap enough cash to find a stable means to replace your day job.

Just a few months prior, a work associate told me about the SBIR program, or Small Business Innovation Research. It's a process in which all government agencies in the US are mandated to spend 3.5% of their research budget on small business research via grants and contracts, and a key goal of the program is to get budding small startups off the ground. It was awesome, and perfect for me. I opened a new LLC, Neurobi Company, with the mission of writing my first proposals and getting enough traction to launch into small business research.

I've never had an issue coming up with ideas - that was the easy part for me. And I had a lot of technical writing experience from my day job. Writing bids for the Department of Transportation and the National Science Foundation was straightforward, but as with all associations with the government, very slow-moving. After six months of proposal writing and six months of painful waiting games, I got word that yet again my request had not been recommended for funding. Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about the SBIR program and I believe I am a better technical writer becasue of it, but the agonizingly slow movement of the program ran my company into the ground. I have all of my communications and documents from this experience. If anybody is interested enough to ask to see it, I would gladly open-source the materials so you can see the level of effort involved and what didn't work for me.

In the meanwhile, I started attending tech startup events around Pittsburgh. I met some very interesting entrepreneurs, heard stories of success then failure, failure then failure, and (very rarely) failure then success. I met some brilliant people who got their PhD's from MIT in robotics, took classes live and in person that I myself studied in the MOOC/OpenCourseWare environments when I'd self-study topics online, and literally knew some of my heroes first-hand. Even these people struggled to keep their businesses afloat. And if not them, what hope did I have? I know it's not as easy as "be technically competent, get your degree, innovate for the benefit of humanity, and prosper financially", but these people are having trouble putting food on the table for their families. I mean this was seriously disheartening for the fate of technically talented people who wanted to use their talents to the fullest, or even just do anything other than being an employee.

I met a guy at work around that time that was a mirror into my own future. He told me he spent his life setting him up to build gadgets, and it never, ever took off for him. He has two successful daughters, a stable job and a happy family life. The tradeoff was that he ended up leaving his passions behind to work a stable job - same place I'm at now. He's a great asset to the company, no doubt, but I think of this man as "the tinkerer that never was". He told me two pieces of advice that I've never forgot: first, you need to be able to write your ideas down. It's important, because you'll need it as a talking point - specifically what he had in mind was a business plan. He also said it's important to be a finisher - to see tasks through to the bitter end. And if you're not, you need to find somebody who is. He said this from his experience in always getting pulled away from what he was working on to investigate some new latest-and-greatest idea, which he felt ultimately was part of his downfall.

These ideas resonated with what I was hearing from the entrepreneurs downtown. At a panel discussion on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Startups in Pittsburgh (spot on for what I was trying to do at the time), the idea that hit me the hardest was the notion of not trying to sell a solution to a problem nobody has. It was in this discussion tha the gurus from industry shared their tales of woe from times they thought they had something seriously great only to realize they were commercial disasters. Honestly I'd have loved to even got far enough along to fail as hard as they have. But it motivated me to really meditate on what it means to fail fast, be agile, and get meaningful customer feedback (noting that "focus groups lie" in the opinion of one man on the panel - so be mindful of where you're getting your data).

Honestly this is where I am today. I haven't yet dissolved Neurobi, as I have yet mroe ideas brewing in the back of my mind.

After two full years of nothing but pain and financial loss, you'd think I should be broken and retire to the sweet relief of my day job. You'd be right - it is very comfortable in room 105. It is seriously tempting. The money is fine, the people are funny, the job is stable and the lifestyle is consistent with many of my life goals. Though this last year dealt a devastating blow to my motivation to pursue technical startups, I haven't quite yet shook off the vestiges of my ambitions. Make no mistake that it would be a lot easier for me to go to medical school or law school or just target being a technical manager at this point and make vastly more money on any of these paths. A lot of my friends I started with as engineers at this company out of college are making these very decisions and meeting great success. Is this right for me? Am I really only in it for the money? Parts of me say yes, but the innovator in my blood is screaming that something about this picture isn't right. Is diverting away from science and technology to these other paths really the best thing I can do to contribute to society in my finite lifetime? If not then why is there so much pain and resistance along the path of technical excellence? Have I not paid my dues? I know the answer to many of these questions, I just don't like the truth and I'm constantly meditating on ways to change this depressing reality that gravitates all technical talent away from the path of unique innovation. Until I come up with a solution to this most fundamentally flawed societal challenge, I have a lot more thinking to do.

## On the value of a PhD for Engineers

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

You will hear from your profs that you need to get the PhD - they of course have a vested interest in feeding the education system. You will hear from your managers that the PhD is something you can do "if you want to" - but they aren't referring to your value to humanity so much as they're referring to "the person that works for them in this role". Your friends and family will have their own wildly varying opinions.

If you're in a situation like me, you have your M.S. in engineering, you have a great relationship with your thesis advisor, you have a full time job that pays more than graduate fellowships ever could, you have the ability to knock out your PhD in only 2 more years and already started (I have this timeline in writing), but to accomplish this it will cost you $10k out of pocket and even though it wouldn't actually devastate your current lifestyle, it is still a very serious time-commitment that may honestly be better spent with your fiancee and your dog.

You may already have formulated your own opinions at this point. "Just get it, you're so close!", or "it's a waste of your time, and you already said it won't get you promoted".

The real rub is that I consider myself a creative thinker and a problem solver. While some students who were 4.0 performers in undergrad struggled through the creative work that comes with graduate research (which undergrad does not prepare you for), I truly thrived and had a great experience. I want to have any reason that justifies making the PhD worthwhile - I love school and have a clear path forward. But I can't justify making major life decisions on a whim such as that. There needs to be an end goal.

I understand that doctor, lawyers, and other professions command high salaries with doctorate level degrees, and that it's simply not the case in technology fields (it's really good and gets a tad bit better with a PhD, don't get me wrong - but at the doctorate level, dollars per unit effort are high for them but close to zero in engineering). So I have to accept that in engineering, you don't get a PhD for money.

So what is a PhD for? Ultimately, you get a PhD to establish a publication record.

To establish a publication record... Why would you want to do that? The answer to that is that you wouldn't. It helps your profs because it makes their lab look better, more attractive for funding, and a host of other reasons that don't benefit the grad student as an individual. Furthermore, your work spills out into the public and improves society by sharing the fruits of your dedicated intellectual work with anyone willing to read it. This all sounds venerable, and from the perspective of the public, it is. It is valuable to everyone, except for the grad student. When it comes down to it, the grad student is eating ramen, spending late nights in the lab for little to no pay, their work is subject to getting shot down when funding or professors move on without them, publications in no sense move the student closer to graduation, yet you know the culture is "publish or perish". Where is the reward? If you want to go the route of your professors, you'll have the opportunity to get pushed around as a postdoc for some poorly defined amount of time following graduation until you hopefully make your way to the first rung of the career ladder at a university somewhere, anywhere you can find a job, late in life relative to an undergrad and with substantially less pay than if you climbed the career ladder intelligently up to that point. Or you could have gone into engineering after undergrad, your MS or your PhD with intentions of doing the best technical work only to realize that, technical managers and executive managers will always make 50% to 100% or more money than an equivalently educated engineer or scientist. Is that a problem? Absolutely not - it's the way the world works (see [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) for details). But it begs the question from the start of your education, what do *you* want?

For me, I realize that I'd love to have a PhD, but at my current standing in life I'm working for the money. I am very willing to bust my behind for the right amount of cash, which I define as the amount of money needed to achieve my life goals in a reasonable amount of time, which is a topic for a different post. I realize that I may find I'll disqualify myself from a lucrative opportunity that would only be available to me with a PhD. There's not a ton I can do about that, because based on best information available from this point in time looking forward, it appears I'll be much better off financially by pursuing the management path, changing careers, or succeeding in entrepreneurial endeavors (which I have worked diligently at since 2017 to no avail, but is also the topic of a different post).

For as much as I hate to say it, and my fiancee will tell just you at how much I've gone back and forth with this, there is no incentive for me to get a PhD in engineering. Even though it would help my prof (who I really think is great) and would help society as the work spills into the public domain, the only person it won't help is me. And that's the bottom line. I'd love to be in a priveleged enough position to say that I don't need to worry about my personal gain in all of this, but here I am.

What is the opportunity cost to society? Luckily I already started my research before backing out (seriously - it's on my transcript), so I know where I was headed. I was working on decentralized reinforcement learning to model and control clusters of dynamic systems. In layman's terms, think of it like robotic swarms or MicroBots from the Disney movie Big Hero 6.

I can't say for sure that my research or anyone else's will benefit society, but what I can say is that the more people can work on their passions, the more society will benefit. Someday, I hope that we restructure society such that the price is right on advanced technical work. As is the case with doctors and lawyers, something tells me that people won't stop working on what they love just because they're making "enough money", but with myself as an example I can guarantee that there are people out there who will stop working on what they love when the money is not there.

Even though I maintain a 4.0 GPA in grad school, this marks my last semester in my PhD. I hope I have a reason to come back.

## Gamifying Exercise

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

I've been handling my workouts as a game, and it has been a blast so far. I have pages of notes as to why this is a reasonable approach, but to keep this post short I'll just explain the mechanics of the game:

1. Pick a set of exercises you believe to provide a full-body workout. This might not be perfect but do your best to capture biceps, back, triceps, chest, legs, shoulders, core. (I've itemized all the muscles in my body before and picked isolation exercises for each, but found it took too long. For practicality reasons, I cut way back). For me personally, I picked:
   1. Bench press (Barbell)
   2. Deadlift (Barbell)
   3. Curls (Dumbbell, one arm at a time)
   4. Front-Raises (Plate held with both hands)
   5. Military Press (Dumbbell, one arm at a time)
   6. Obliques (Dumbbell or plate, one arm at a time while standing)
   7. Run (Increments of 1 mile)

2. For each of these, I came up with a leveling system (like in a video game) as to how many reps at what weight would get me to the next level (or benchmark). Reps are added up over time like experience points
   1. Bench press
      * Complete "tutorial mode" after performing 1,000 reps at 135 lbs
      * 10,000 reps at 135 lbs gets me to level 9
      * 10,000 reps at 315 lbs gets me to level 99
   2. Deadlift
      * 10,000 reps at 135 lbs gets me to level 9
      * 10,000 reps at 315 lbs gets me to level 99
   3. Curls
      * 10,000 reps at 20 lbs earns me the benchmark Curls I
      * 10,000 reps at 25 lbs earns me the benchmark Curls II
      * I have yet to devise a mapping to what I consider level 99 in curls
   4. Front-Raises
      * 10,000 reps at 25 lbs earns me the benchmark Front Raises I
   5. Military Press
      * 10,000 reps at 20 lbs earns me the benchmark Military Press I
   6. Obliques
      * 10,000 reps at 35 lbs earns me the benchmark Obliques I
   7. Run
      * Starting from level 0, level up every 249 miles up to level 99 at 24,900
      * Go "the extra mile" to achieve benchmark Globe Trotter I (circumference of Earth is 24,901 miles)
      * Achieve benchmark Moonwalker at Globe Trotter IX (this is the distance to the moon at perigee) (Even for avid runners, this will take many years. But it's still a great goal!)

3. I picked the above for my own reasons. I believe that working out doesn't need to be difficult or mysterious and that reps at a given weight is sufficient to make real progress and measure it. The core premises are:
   1. Measurable progress is motivating
   2. Measuring progress should be as simple as possible so as not to distract from the goal
   3. While both are important, workout consistency is more valuable than optimality
   4. Fewer workouts risks less muscle coverage, yet increases likelihood of consistency
   5. Increasing weight implies progress
   6. Increasing weight prematurely risks injury
   7. Reps are the primary way to prepare yourself to increase weight without injury
   8. Too many reps at a time may risk injury, but is easily mitigated by self-regulation
   9. There is a number of reps at a given weight that if you do that many, you will feel prepared to increase the weight (10,000 is the number I picked where I feel confident enough to increase the weight without hesitation)
   10. The proposed leveling system is based on my notions of what it means to be strong, which is based anecdotally on the people that I have met combined with aggregate stats posted online and my own opinion. The level thresholds themselves are less important than the notion that you can make progress in a way that is easy to track and clearly rewards your efforts by increasing experience points (a.k.a. reps) and leveling-up
   11. People may disagree with the specifics of this methodology, but with bench as an example, I conjecture anyone would agree that if you accomplish 10,000 reps at a given weight you're ready to add a few pounds, and I further conjecture that if you accomplish 10,000 reps at a "high weight" (315 lbs for example), you'll perceive yourself to be "strong" or at least stronger than you were

## On Leadership

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

For the longest time, I considered myself to only ever be on the "technical track" as opposed to the "management track" at work. In my line of business, we are very engineer-heavy. Which I obviously personally think is great. The formula is: get a high GPA, get hired here as an engineer, choose your own adventure, retire as an engineer that's paid more than when you started or as a manager that's paid more than when your engineers ended. Aside from the allure of the money, which wasn't quite enough to persuade me to join the dark side, some of my friends started along the management track that I wouldn't necessarily have expected. So they're picking up insights and passing them to me as they go along, which has helped shape my perspective.

The most compelling sell was that a key function of (first-line) management is to help set the technical strategic direction of their unit. In the earliest stages of my career as an engineer, I had been plagued with the issue that (to my knowledge) all engineers who are just starting out are subjected to. The senior engineers assume that if you're younger than them, you're not in a position to make desicions. This is not a great attitude to say the least, and there's honestly not a ton of senior engineers that will treat you that way but it only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.

Now that I'm mentoring new engineers to the company, I am making a conscientious effort to empower their decisions as they learn the ropes of the company. It's tempting to write people off and assume they're coming in Tabula Rasa - maybe it makes you feel experienced or in some way better - but aside from brushing your own ego, that's a contest nobody wins. Everyone has unique perspectives and knowledge that I can appreciate and benefit from, as long as I remain careful to keep myself humble to the fact that this will always remain true throughout my entire career.

Personally, I find that beginning with the end in mind is an absolute strongsuit of mine. I've been told that engineers are passionate about completing their projects and doing a great job. Of course I am, but only if it's meeting some bottom line. I have no issue at all dropping a project that's 90% if we realized late-stage it's all of the sudden leading to a dead-end. The completionist in me is not as opinionated as the strategist.

After voicing an interest in going the management route, my boss recommended a great book to me that is relevant in many ways to our line of work. It's called [Turn the Ship Around](https://ti-pdf-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a2db0dfc-5ef0-4885-bc3c-d7ff27972c4a/pdf_output/English/118723063.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIQBOMCVUHTOT3DFQ&Expires=1578866811&Signature=bl7t0S78p%2B7qT6gf74dq6sak3Fg%3D), and a highly recommended read for managers and new engineers alike.

It hits my frustrations from my early career as an engineer straight on the head, and discusses:
1. The inherent frustrations that stem from the leader-follower approach to leadership
2. How to set up a working system that empowers the entire chain of command to do their best work
3. Why this isn't straightforward and the pressures that make it feel easier to jut give up and go back to the leader-follower model
4. The benefits of persisting with an empowering approach

If you're an early stage engineer who has been exposed to the pain of the leader-follower model, just know that there are other ways, that there are reasons those methods probably haven't caught on at your place of work, and if you can understand the perspective of the people you're working with, there is always the hope that you can effectively build your case to all stakeholders for the design path you feel is right. If waiting for respect to arise as a natureal consequence of your age and other people's unintentional cognitive bias isn't your style, I'd recommend you start preparing for your uphill battle by reading [Turn the Ship Around](https://ti-pdf-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/a2db0dfc-5ef0-4885-bc3c-d7ff27972c4a/pdf_output/English/118723063.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIQBOMCVUHTOT3DFQ&Expires=1578866811&Signature=bl7t0S78p%2B7qT6gf74dq6sak3Fg%3D).

## Augmented Reality with Web Components

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

Web components are great, aren't they? If you do web development professionally or as a hobby, you've probably come across new features known as web components that make life a lot easier.

I'll tell a quick story to motivate [this project](https://asa55.github.io/fun-with-scene-viewer/)

My fiancee along with some friends and I were playing Dungeons and Dragons, which for the uninitiated is easily described as a game of imagination. We have a lot of fun building the world around the game by creating art for the characters and the make-believe world we've devised from scratch in which the game occurs.

In keeping with this notion of creating art to visualize our world, along our imaginary journey we acquired a special item (kind of like a compass) that will help our team navigate around an underground cavern in search of goblins. 

For fun, I wanted to mock-up this item as a 3D model, and use augmented reality capabilities (that are now common across many mobile phones) to visualize this item on the table where we play the game.

This seemed like a simple goal - I knew that the software to model a room using only the camera feed was out there, and that the only thing I really needed to identify was a tool that would let me drop a 3D model into.

I dug around for a while and found a variety of paid apps and subscriptions and all manners of things that required cloud services and internet connectivity. This went completely against my gut feeling that this should be an easy and inexpensive problem to solve.

Finally I realized that there was a recent addition to the web (thanks to web components) referred to as Model Viewer that lets you do the trick using your browser. It was awesome, it was easy, it was minimal, it was free, it was exactly what I needed.

The basic idea is super simple:
1. Make your 3D model (I used Blender and exported as .glb)
2. Host your model on your website (I used GitHub) and include it via html using the right tags
3. The AR functionality "just works"!

It's a great tool and the project took only an afternoon to complete. If you're viewing this page on your mobile device, [check out the model at this link](https://asa55.github.io/fun-with-scene-viewer/) to see the 3D model, then click the AR function button in the bottom right corner of the 3D model to activate AR mode and see it in the room you're currently in via your camera feed!

## On Optimistic Nihilism

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

Here's a fun one. Outside of the privacy of my own blog, I don't tend to bring this up because everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. I hope the reader understands that I am not attempting to convince them of anything regarding their system of beliefs. If this topic is something you'd rather not discuss, I encourage you to skip this section. For those of you who are interested and/or won't judge me negitively or positively on the basis of my beliefs, please read on.

There was a time when humanity thought that the world was governed by a creator. As we began to understand the world, many observations previously attributed to the wrath of a higher power were replaced with answers that could withstand scientific scrutiny. Those that believe(d) in god(s) started to accept that answers of "how" trumped answers of "why", that the universe is indifferent, that motivation is a human concept, and that the place for god within the framework of logical human reasoning is an ever shrinking "gap".

In logic, any argument analogous to Russell's Teapot can't be proven wrong. Practically but not quite accurately speaking, "you can't prove a negative". The caveat to that is when you can set up an experiment where you test the entire universe of possibilities and can prove that if the thing you're looking for isn't in any of them, then it must be in none of them. But of course this is not possible, so it is not a testable hypothesis, so it is not scientific.

That being said, it is perfectly valid to conjecture that any manner of Russell's Teapots could live inside this untestable space, so if any believer approached me and clarified that their god is a god of the gaps, then I wouldn't even attempt to try and disprove them. Aside from the fact that I don't mind whatever they decide to believe, it's simply a debate that is impossible to settle.

Now, I personally don't conjecture the existence of anything that I don't have scientific evidence to support. There are many forms of evidence, but some evidence may have resulted from many possible explanations, while other forms of evidence can really only mean one of a few things. Furthermore, the "smoking gun" type of evidence needs to be repeatable and corroborate with other evidence that is also repeatable. I realize there are lots of questions we like to ask based on evidence we've collected that can't be proven in this way. I find that it is okay to realize that some answers that are really important to us are lost to the sands of time. We can do our best to try and wrap our heads around the most likely reason for this shroud or that empty tomb, but I find it is similarly okay to accept that there isn't sufficient evidence to test some hypotheses using the methods of science. Just like Russell's Teapot, if the test is impractical, it is not scientific, but that doesn't mean it is (or isn't) true.

With that in mind, we could conjecture the existence of a lot of things which don't have sufficient evidence to support. While valid, I find that there would be too much to mentally keep track of if I conjecture the existence of this and that, within the confines of "the gap".

To be specific, I would classify myself as an agnostic athiest. I find that there is a gap, that anything may or may not be inside, so I don't make arbitrary conjectures about what's inside. This is contrary to the "agnostic theist" who realizes that there is a gap, and speculates that god lives inside it. Both schools of thought are logically valid, so they shouldn't have any reason to argue. Any argument would be fruitless. And I won't here discuss the burden of proof, but if needed that is a key benefit of swaying toward the side of agnostic athiesm.

More strongly, Stephen Hawking famously made a compelling argument that god is not needed to describe any natural phenomenon in all of space and across all of time, before or after, inside or out.

Note that he did make the claim that god does not exist, though his argument doesn't rely on it, and it's still logically valid to accept Hawking's argument while remaining an agnostic theist. It's just another one of those times where science yet again shrinks the gap in which god can logically live.

But to quote Neil deGrasse Tyson, saying that god is the answer closes doors to more questions, while acknowledging you don't know the answer opens them.

That's enough on the topic of belief. I think my stance is probably clear enough, and as with all ancient religions, as the remainder continue to fade into history texts as a matter of anthropological interest, I find that it is an interesting time to be alive. We get to witness this interesting age of enlightenment where it is both generally accepted that there is no logical basis to conjecture the existence of god, yet there are decreasingly many people who do.

I'll wrap up the topic of my perception of the nature of our existence. We are living things (humans), made up of smaller living things (cells), made up of tiny things that are themselves not living (molecules), made up of tinier things that are themselves not living (atoms), made up of tinier things that are themselves not living (the particle zoo from the standard model of physics), that interact in ways that are prescriptive and work according to the standard model of physics. Work your way in reverse, back up the chain, and you'll find that the universe and everything in it (us included) is made up of tiny bits of nonliving things that follow the laws of physics. What makes us "alive"? Well let's start from how life began... stars built heavier atoms out of hydrogen, those atoms and randomly generated molecules distributed themselves throughout the universe including Earth, random interactions of atoms and molecules over long spans of time eventually created a wild bootstrapping process which was a molecule that was self organizing (not in a motivated way - just chemical interactions that were self organizing - bootstrapping processes aren't miraculous - every time you boot up your computer you're experiencing the phenomenon of similar behavior), this self organizing process snowballed into a single-celled organism, which itself is made up of nonliving molecules and is not imbued with anything special - we only call it alive in hindsight but it's not different than any other nonliving self organizing molecules that made it and we are not fundamentally different (in terms of "how alive" we are) compared to the single-cell organism that kicked of the chain of evolution that led to us. From the perspective of the universe, we are no more alive than a single-celled organism nor a rock. Some of the implications of this are that free will (in the standard sense) is not the way the world works. Depending on your views this may sound daft, but before you throw it out I recommend you read [Free Will by Sam Harris](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjRyZeW9_7mAhUPUt8KHRsqBToQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docdroid.net%2Ffile%2Fdownload%2F5ty6HuO%2Ffree-will-sam-harris.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21do3zHyZQz-cNuePPC1JK), in which I disagree with his political/social implications (because humans respond to feedback, including (albeit imperfectly) punishment) but I 100% agree with his notions on how we work.

So I don't identify as an agnostic athiest exactly, because going around telling people all the things you *don't believe in* is an odd thing to do. I classify myself as a nihilist, which I should define as the observation that motivation and meaning is not an inherent property of the universe. Now, that's a mega-bummer right? If nothing matters, what moves me on a day-to-day basis? Dosen't that mean I can just do awful things without fear of recourse? The answer is of course not. Aside from the fact that I have a heart, we all live within a society. If any individual in a society gets too far out of line, there will be consequences which vary by circumstance. The universe will never see your actions as good or bad, but the people around you will. We all act in our own rational self interest to some extent.

So if the universe doesn't see anything we do as good or bad, what's the point? This is an excellent question. There are plenty of great resources on nihilism that dive into this topic, but the weird part is that there is no point from the perspective of the universe. But from your perspective, and the people around you, there can be. You get to choose that, or not if you don't want to.

At this point, I'll inject my own agenda. Any nihilist who says anything beyond the aforementioned is imposing their own agenda. There is no reason from the perspective of the universe to take any action at all. In the worst cases, this means that if you decided to curl up and die, the universe would find it equally meaningless as being the first person to discover cure a major disease. Any action (or inaction) is equivalently meaningless, *HOWEVER* there is a key insight that I hope to convey which shapes my views on how to live my life. It ultimately leads to what [some people call positive or optimistic nihilism](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin687--f7mAhXyuFkKHQk1AowQwqsBMAB6BAgIEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMBRqu0YOH14&usg=AOvVaw1t-ZYn8KW_uas6N9CQqdMU). The observation is that we are humans in human bodies living human lives - and over millenia your ancestors and mine have evolved to create the people you and I are today. We are not responsible for our physical configuration, and we are not responsible for what experiences lead to what emotional responses in our brains. But the one thing we do know is that we can interact with our environment to experiment with the things that make us feel "good" versus "bad". I am not suggesting doing things that are illegal - don't forget that you will inevitably interpret the ramifications of social consequence as "bad" if you catch the wrong attention. What I am suggesting is that we don't know exactly what or why certain behaviors, objectives, or actions will make us feel positive, but this is hard-coded into the nature-nurture interaction that shaped us into the people we are today. We don't control it, but we can experiment with it. And it is precisely this objective of discovering what makes me feel like a better human being that drives me to pursue awesome things. Even without "external guidance" it's literally who I am, and if you decide to take the same approach, I find it highly likely you'll discover it's who you are as well.

The last thing I want to mention is a list of some beautiful pieces of art that explore very important questions on the nature of things. Nobody's word should be taken as gospel, including mine. These pieces are just a few that come to mind that (depending on your personality type) can lead to some valuable meditations. Please try not to laugh these off - I am very serious that I found these extremely worthy of my attention.

## On Language and the Human Experience

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

Remember the movie Interstellar (2014)? It was one of those awesome sci-fi movies about space travel that carefully treads the line between fiction and modern physics. This movie had it all, at least until "that part" when Anne Hathaway goes off on a tangent about how love is something we can perceive and is the only thing that can transcend the boundaries of space and time. If I were a movie critic I'd like to think I'd have thrown a tomato at the big screen during the premiere at the exact instant those words were uttered. At the time I remember hoping it was just a metaphor or something, but as I recall, it wasn't the backward propagation of gravitational waves through time that saved the day (an awesome and modern concept presented in the movie), but love. Damn you Hollywood - this is why we can't have nice things.

But this scene got me thinking about exactly what might have struck a nerve with me when I saw it. I think it boils down to the observation that precision of language is extremely important to me (where possible). Search the word "love" in the dictionary and you'll find an enumeration of equally vague definitions. (Except when "love" means a score of zero in tennis, which I find to be satisfyingly precise). Love can mean just about anything, but unfortunately for Interstellar, a physical force is not one of them.

I'm not trying to invalidate human emotion. We can agree that biological responses in the human body are very real - they're the result of electrochemical processes we can't control. These processes affect our sensorimotor cortex as physical sensation and/or muscle response (shaky hands, for instance). We use the small set of describing words we call "emotions" (love among them) in an attempt to categorize salient symptoms of an extremely complex process. But there is a distinct difference. I'm confident that given a complete description of the configuration of all the particles that make "you", there is enough information encoded to accurately determine what you're experiencing as "emotion". However, given a description of your emotional state, the reverse is definitely not possible.

Now I'm not the kind of guy to say that all language *must be* precise - quite the opposite actually. It's neither valid nor practical to assume that Boolean logic is "the right" view of the world. There is such a thing as being in-between "true" and "false". This gray-area is captured by fuzzy logic - a field of study where the degree of truth can be quantified. The classic example to compare Boolean to fuzzy logic is answering the question "is it warm out?". This is a valid question. It doesn't even feel right to apply Boolean logic in this case - if it's 50 degrees Fahrenheit you might call it warm, but at some point you need to say it's no longer warm. Are you really going to say with 100% confidence that 50 degrees is warm but 49.99 degrees is 100% not? Fuzzy logic lets you do things like interpolate smoothly between the ranges of "hot" and "cold" - so when you're asked yes-or-no questions like "is it warm", you have an additional yet critical piece of information that lets you quantify how certain you are of your answer at that temperature (presumably you'd be close to 50% certain at 50 degrees, in this scenario).

The important thing to remember in all of this is that discussing abstract topics relevant to our day-to-day experience can be much more complex than it might seem at first glance. The way we apply language to abstract scenarios is inherently informationally lossy - there is a 100% guarantee that some fraction of the information you wish to convey will be impossible to communicate fully. Our feelings and experiences are subject to a chaotic feedback loop of electrochemistry well beyond our ability to control, and well beyond our ability to use words to describe precisely. This doesn't invalidate our experience, and it doesn't cheapen the meaning behind our discussions. But it's good to keep in mind that buried beneath our words is a layer of ambiguity that we can't avoid. When it matters most, we should do our best to try to understand one another's underlying message, and the best way for us to try to move in the right direction is to understand the mechanics of language, logic, and ourselves.

## Notes from a 3D Printer Build

<details>
<summary>
...
</summary>

A few days ago I got an off-brand version of an Ender 3 in the mail. Thanks Creality - it's a great product. But I'm realizing now that the folks who came up with Ender 3 are in some legal battles with other people taking their idea for open-sourced hardware and up-selling on Amazon. I hope that my purchase actually helped the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in some way. The box and printer I got are branded as Ender 3 and included a few additional Creality branded parts (like a glass build plate), so I believe the OEM still made money on the sale (to me via Creality).

I followed the assembly instructions that came with the machine and it went smoothly. But this machine has overwhelmingly positive and active community support, so I still found some great [wikis](https://github.com/rlogiacco/3DP/wiki) / [blogs](https://all3dp.com/1/creality-ender-3-pro-3d-printer-review/) / [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPb81Z-Cw4oheuYfZy9GHORyQOY0aDgod) that helped me get mine running smoothly.

I appreciated Creality shipping their custom slicer - it had all the community-recommended magic numbers set as default, but it didn't work when I went to print. Uninstalled and went for the latest version of Cura - now I'm up and running. I love that there are add-ons in Cura to let me open .glb files - the same as I used for my recent AR project! I've heard people had challenges leveling the bed - I'm not having any such issues as yet, but I have been leveling manually without using the leveling wizard tool.

Here's a time-lapse gif of my build progress as I went along. Next time I make a time-lapse gif, I think I'll increase the frequency of photo-ops.
