I realize to an extent experts should "stay in their lane". My expertise is in engineering, but my interests include almost everything. I may comment on lots of topics here where you could rightly question my authority to make such claims, and with that in mind I will attempt to expose my line of reasoning openly enough that you can attack my premises rather than perceptions of my expertise.

## On the value of a PhD for Engineers

You will hear from your profs that you need to get the PhD - they of course have a vested interest in feeding the education system. You will hear from your managers that the PhD is something you can do "if you want to" - but they aren't referring to your value to humanity so much as they're referring to "the person that works for them in this role". Your friends and family will have their own wildly varying opinions.

If you're in a situation like me, you have your M.S. in engineering, you have a great relationship with your thesis advisor, you have a full time job that pays more than graduate fellowships ever could, you have the ability to knock out your PhD in only 2 more years and already started (I have this timeline in writing), but to accomplish this it will cost you $10k out of pocket and even though it wouldn't actually devastate your current lifestyle, it is still a very serious time-commitment that may honestly be better spent with your fiancee and your dog.

You may already have formulated your own opinions at this point. "Just get it, you're so close!", or "it's a waste of your time, and you already said it won't get you promoted".

The real rub is that I consider myself a creative thinker and a problem solver. While some students who were 4.0 performers in undergrad struggled through the creative work that comes with graduate research (which undergrad does not prepare you for), I truly thrived and had a great experience. I want to have any reason that justifies making the PhD worthwhile - I love school and have a clear path forward. But I can't justify making major life decisions on a whim such as that. There needs to be an end goal.

I understand that doctor, lawyers, and other professions command high salaries with doctorate level degrees, and that it's simply not the case in technology fields (it's really good and gets a tad bit better with a PhD, don't get me wrong - but at the doctorate level, dollars per unit effort are high for them but close to zero in engineering). So I have to accept that in engineering, you don't get a PhD for money.

So what is a PhD for? Ultimately, you get a PhD to establish a publication record.

To establish a publication record... Why would you want to do that? The answer to that is that you wouldn't. It helps your profs because it makes their lab look better, more attractive for funding, and a host of other reasons that don't benefit the grad student as an individual. Furthermore, your work spills out into the public and improves society by sharing the fruits of your dedicated intellectual work with anyone willing to read it. This all sounds venerable, and from the perspective of the public, it is. It is valuable to everyone, except for the grad student. When it comes down to it, the grad student is eating ramen, spending late nights in the lab for little to no pay, their work is subject to getting shot down when funding or professors move on without them, publications in no sense move the student closer to graduation, yet you know the culture is "publish or perish". Where is the reward? If you want to go the route of your professors, you'll have the opportunity to get pushed around as a postdoc for some poorly defined amount of time following graduation until you hopefully make your way to the first rung of the career ladder at a university somewhere, anywhere you can find a job, late in life relative to an undergrad and with substantially less pay than if you climbed the career ladder intelligently up to that point. Or you could have gone into engineering after undergrad, your MS or your PhD with intentions of doing the best technical work only to realize that, technical managers and executive managers will always make 50% to 100% or more money than an equivalently educated engineer or scientist. Is that a problem? Absolutely not - it's the way the world works (see [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) for details). But it begs the question from the start of your education, what do *you* want?

For me, I realize that I'd love to have a PhD, but at my current standing in life I'm working for the money. I am very willing to bust my behind for the right amount of cash, which I define as the amount of money needed to achieve my life goals in a reasonable amount of time, which is a topic for a different post. I realize that I may find I'll disqualify myself from a lucrative opportunity that would only be available to me with a PhD. There's not a ton I can do about that, because based on best information available from this point in time looking forward, it appears I'll be much better off financially by pursuing the management path, changing careers, or succeeding in entrepreneurial endeavors (which I have worked diligently at since 2017 to no avail, but is also the topic of a different post).

For as much as I hate to say it, and my fiancee will tell just you at how much I've gone back and forth with this, there is no incentive for me to get a PhD in engineering. Even though it would help my prof (who I really think is great) and would help society as the work spills into the public domain, the only person it won't help is me. And that's the bottom line. I'd love to be in a priveleged enough position to say that I don't need to worry about my personal gain in all of this, but here I am.

What is the opportunity cost to society? Luckily I already started my research before backing out (seriously - it's on my transcript), so I know where I was headed. I was working on decentralized reinforcement learning to model and control clusters of dynamic systems. In layman's terms, think of it like robotic swarms or MicroBots from the Disney movie Big Hero 6.

I can't say for sure that my research or anyone else's will benefit society, but what I can say is that the more people can work on their passions, the more society will benefit. Someday, I hope that we restructure society such that the price is right on advanced technical work. As is the case with doctors and lawyers, something tells me that people won't stop working on what they love just because they're making "enough money", but with myself as an example I can guarantee that there are people out there who will stop working on what they love when the money is not there.

Even though I maintain a 4.0 GPA in grad school, this marks my last semester in my PhD. I hope I have a reason to come back.

## Gamifying Exercise

I've been handling my workouts as a game, and it has been a blast so far. I have pages of notes as to why this is a reasonable approach, but to keep this post short I'll just explain the mechanics of the game:

1. Pick a set of exercises you believe to provide a full-body workout. This might not be perfect but do your best to capture biceps, back, triceps, chest, legs, shoulders, core. (I've itemized all the muscles in my body before and picked isolation exercises for each, but found it took too long. For practicality reasons, I cut way back). For me personally, I picked:
   1. Bench press (Barbell)
   2. Deadlift (Barbell)
   3. Curls (Dumbbell, one arm at a time)
   4. Front-Raises (Plate held with both hands)
   5. Military Press (Dumbbell, one arm at a time)
   6. Obliques (Dumbbell or plate, one arm at a time while standing)
   7. Run (Increments of 1 mile)

2. For each of these, I came up with a leveling system (like in a video game) as to how many reps at what weight would get me to the next level (or benchmark). Reps are added up over time like experience points
   1. Bench press
      * Complete "tutorial mode" after performing 1,000 reps at 135 lbs
      * 10,000 reps at 135 lbs gets me to level 9
      * 10,000 reps at 315 lbs gets me to level 99
   2. Deadlift
      * 10,000 reps at 135 lbs gets me to level 9
      * 10,000 reps at 315 lbs gets me to level 99
   3. Curls
      * 10,000 reps at 20 lbs earns me the benchmark Curls I
      * 10,000 reps at 25 lbs earns me the benchmark Curls II
      * I have yet to devise a mapping to what I consider level 99 in curls
   4. Front-Raises
      * 10,000 reps at 25 lbs earns me the benchmark Front Raises I
   5. Military Press
      * 10,000 reps at 20 lbs earns me the benchmark Military Press I
   6. Obliques
      * 10,000 reps at 35 lbs earns me the benchmark Obliques I
   7. Run
      * Starting from level 0, level up every 249 miles up to level 99 at 24,900
      * Go "the extra mile" to achieve benchmark Globe Trotter I (circumference of Earth is 24,901 miles)
      * Achieve benchmark Moonwalker at Globe Trotter IX (this is the distance to the moon at perigee) (Even for avid runners, this will take many years. But it's still a great goal!)

3. I picked the above for my own reasons. I believe that working out doesn't need to be difficult or mysterious and that reps at a given weight is sufficient to make real progress and measure it. The core premises are:
   1. Measurable progress is motivating
   2. Measuring progress should be as simple as possible so as not to distract from the goal
   3. While both are important, workout consistency is more valuable than optimality
   4. Fewer workouts risks less muscle coverage, yet increases likelihood of consistency
   5. Increasing weight implies progress
   6. Increasing weight prematurely risks injury
   7. Reps are the primary way to prepare yourself to increase weight without injury
   8. Too many reps at a time may risk injury, but is easily mitigated by self-regulation
   9. There is a number of reps at a given weight that if you do that many, you will feel prepared to increase the weight (10,000 is the number I picked where I feel confident enough to increase the weight without hesitation)
   10. The proposed leveling system is based on my notions of what it means to be strong, which is based anecdotally on the people that I have met combined with aggregate stats posted online and my own opinion. The level thresholds themselves are less important than the notion that you can make progress in a way that is easy to track and clearly rewards your efforts by increasing experience points (a.k.a. reps) and leveling-up
   11. People may disagree with the specifics of this methodology, but with bench as an example, I conjecture anyone would agree that if you accomplish 10,000 reps at a given weight you're ready to add a few pounds, and I further conjecture that if you accomplish 10,000 reps at a "high weight" (315 lbs for example), you'll perceive yourself to be "strong" or at least stronger than you were

## Augmented Reality with Web Components

Web components are great, aren't they? If you do web development professionally or as a hobby, you've probably come across new features known as web components that make life a lot easier.

I'll tell a quick story to motivate [this project](https://asa55.github.io/fun-with-scene-viewer/)

My fiancee along with some friends and I were playing Dungeons and Dragons, which for the uninitiated is easily described as a game of imagination. We have a lot of fun building the world around the game by creating art for the characters and the make-believe world we've devised from scratch in which the game occurs.

In keeping with this notion of creating art to visualize our world, along our imaginary journey we acquired a special item (kind of like a compass) that will help our team navigate around an underground cavern in search of goblins. 

For fun, I wanted to mock-up this item as a 3D model, and use augmented reality capabilities (that are now common across many mobile phones) to visualize this item on the table where we play the game.

This seemed like a simple goal - I knew that the software to model a room using only the camera feed was out there, and that the only thing I really needed to identify was a tool that would let me drop a 3D model into.

I dug around for a while and found a variety of paid apps and subscriptions and all manners of things that required cloud services and internet connectivity. This went completely against my gut feeling that this should be an easy and inexpensive problem to solve.

Finally I realized that there was a recent addition to the web (thanks to web components) referred to as Model Viewer that lets you do the trick using your browser. It was awesome, it was easy, it was minimal, it was free, it was exactly what I needed.

The basic idea is super simple:
1. Make your 3D model (I used Blender and exported as .glb)
2. Host your model on your website (I used GitHub) and include it via html using the right tags
3. The AR functionality "just works"!

It's a great tool and the project took only an afternoon to complete. If you're viewing this page on your mobile device, [check out the model at this link](https://asa55.github.io/fun-with-scene-viewer/) to see the 3D model, then click the AR function button in the bottom right corner of the 3D model to activate AR mode and see it in the room you're currently in via your camera feed!
