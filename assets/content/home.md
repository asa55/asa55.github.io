### Alex Augenstein: Engineer, Scientist, Entrepreneur

## This site is in active development. In a sense this is for professional demonstration, but the content of this site is a compilation of my own personal reference notes I actually use and come back to. I hope you find this resource insightful as you browse around, and if you have any suggestions please feel free to [share your thoughts with me on GitHub](https://github.com/asa55/asa55.github.io/issues)

## A little bit about me

### Education

   * Thesis title 'Feudal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Revisited'

### Other
* I enjoyed robotics club and ham radio club in college - my callsign is KD8UYM though you won't catch me on the airwaves any time soon (just sold my most recent rig a few months ago)
* I also loved 3D printing - past-tense because my last one was well-loved. I used it for all kinds of things including a self-study course in grad school for printing the brunt of an Arduino-controlled inverted pendulum. Naturally it caught fire at the last minute - I improvised with some other materials I had laying around and got it to work, but haven't bought a new one since then (but it's a buyer's market right now so you never know - the price has come down by a factor of 5 since I got my first one)
* I'm a big fan of open source code. [Find me on GitHub](https://github.com/asa55) just for fun or to see the source code for this site
