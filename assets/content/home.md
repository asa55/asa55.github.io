# Thanks for stopping by!

## This site is under active development. As a matter of interest I've rev'd this site 4 times total starting with a basic HTML/CSS/JS static web app, then again using the VueJS framework, then again using heavy animations with the canvas element, and now once more with the help of Web Components to render some markdown files where I am storing the brunt of the site content.

## This is mostly to demo my personal interests, but there are some good summary details on here that would be useful to others for "cracking the coding interview", or just to learn something new (hopefully!)

## Please check back soon for updates
