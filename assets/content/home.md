### Alex Augenstein: Engineer, Scientist, Entrepreneur

## This site is in active development. It is mostly to demo my personal interests, but there are some good summary details on here that would be useful to others for "cracking the coding interview", or just to learn something new (hopefully!)

## A little bit about me
### Work
* Founder, [Neurobi Company](neurobi.com), 2019 - pres.
* Engineer, Naval Nuclear Laboratory, 2015 - pres.
* Research Assistant, University of Pittsburgh, Fall 2014
* Research Assistant, University of Zwickau (Germany), Summer 2014
* Intern, Harris Corporation, Spring - Summer 2012
* More on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/alex-augenstein)

### Education
* PhD Candidate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 2019 - pres.
* M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 2016 - 2019
   * Thesis title 'Feudal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Revisited'
   * Transferred in ME67500 for credit from Purdue University, a distance-enabled graduate course in robust multivariable control
* B.S., Electrical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 - 2015
   * Minor in mathematics
   * Concentration in signal processing and (analog & digital) communication systems

### Other
* I enjoyed robotics club and ham radio club in college - my callsign is KD8UYM though you won't catch me on the airwaves any time soon (just sold my most recent rig a few months ago)
* I also loved 3D printing - past-tense because my last one was well-loved. I used it for all kinds of things including a self-study course in grad school for printing the brunt of an Arduino-controlled inverted pendulum. Naturally it caught fire at the last minute - I improvised with some other materials I had laying around and got it to work, but haven't bought a new one since then (but it's a buyer's market right now so you never know - the price has come down by a factor of 5 since I got my first one)
