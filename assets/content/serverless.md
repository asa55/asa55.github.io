# Serverless Computing

To visualize what this is all about, see [this classic tutorial from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/)

## What Makes Serverless Great

* No server management with automated high availability
   * This aspect is abstracted away from developers. Why pull dev resources away from innovation to perform IT related work when you can have improved security and uptime for less?
* Flexible scaling and pay for value
   * The serverless model is pay-as-you-go. Serverless providers charge for units of consumption rather than units of individual servers
