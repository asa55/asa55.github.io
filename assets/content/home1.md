## This site is in active development. In a sense this is for professional demonstration, but the content of this site is a compilation of my own personal reference notes I actually use and come back to. I hope you find this resource insightful as you browse around, and if you have any suggestions please feel free to [share your thoughts with me on GitHub](https://github.com/asa55/asa55.github.io/issues)

## A note on the implementation for this site:
### The navbar on the left scrolls separately from the content window (where you're reading now) - depending on your screen size you might be able to find more content this way
### The content is stored in markdown (.md) files. This is rendered nicely in your browser thanks to zero-md
### Markdown supports inline html, which I will use liberally as I update this site. For example, here is a cart-pole demo (that you can interact by clicking and dragging) thanks to the MatterJS physics engine
#### It's just a skeleton right now but soon I'll add some control-system smarts to it and drop it in the real-time control section of this site...
