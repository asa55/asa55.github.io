# Notes from a 3D Printer Build

<details>

A few days ago I got an off-brand version of an Ender 3 in the mail. Thanks Creality - it's a great product. But I'm realizing now that the folks who came up with Ender 3 are in some legal battles with other people taking their idea for open-sourced hardware and up-selling on Amazon. I hope that my purchase actually helped the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in some way. The box and printer I got are branded as Ender 3 and included a few additional Creality branded parts (like a glass build plate), so I believe the OEM still made money on the sale (to me via Creality).

I followed the assembly instructions that came with the machine and it went smoothly. But this machine has overwhelmingly positive and active community support, so I still found some great [wikis](https://github.com/rlogiacco/3DP/wiki) / [blogs](https://all3dp.com/1/creality-ender-3-pro-3d-printer-review/) / [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPb81Z-Cw4oheuYfZy9GHORyQOY0aDgod) that helped me get mine running smoothly.

I appreciated Creality shipping their custom slicer - it had all the community-recommended magic numbers set as default, but it didn't work when I went to print. Uninstalled and went for the latest version of Cura - now I'm up and running. I love that there are add-ons in Cura to let me open .glb files - the same as I used for my recent AR project! I've heard people had challenges leveling the bed - I'm not having any such issues as yet, but I have been leveling manually without using the leveling wizard tool.

Here's a time-lapse gif of my build progress as I went along. Next time I make a time-lapse gif, I think I'll increase the frequency of photo-ops.

# Robotics Warmup

A friend and I were talking over a few ideas to vet my printer and shake off the 3D modeling rust in an effort to start making some more serious robotics builds.

We spitballed a few ideas for basic force multiplying devices and useful hardware to supplement the prints. I got a hold of assorted springs, gaskets, M3 - M5 machine screws and bolts, and some 3mm pin stock.

Eventually we came up with the idea of comparing gripping devices for some of our designs while we consider the pros and cons of different approaches.

The first print turned out pretty well - the workflow to make it was (1) draft a blueprint by hand with key dimensions (2) construct 3D model in Blender, export as .stl (3) import .stl file into Ultimaker Cura to generate a printable .gcode file (4) drop the file onto an SD card, transfer to the printer and let it rip. The most time consuming aspect of this was the print itself which took a little less than 2 hours.
