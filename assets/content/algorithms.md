# Algorithms

## I am excited to get some algorithm demos up using both JS and Python. While I love Jupyter notebooks, I think I can do what I need to do using Brython! (It parses Python using JS so you can use Python as an in-browser scripting language!) It's slower than JS but I need to showcase Python, and I would rather incur minor in-browser overhead as opposed to redirecting users to another page just to demo some algorithms
