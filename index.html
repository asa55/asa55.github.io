  <p>We're all having fun right? I am an employee and an entrepreneur. I come from a control systems background (among many other things) starting as an EE that migrated to ML (all the cool control kids are doing it), then realized the world of production software was my best path to getting out of the job I find to be "meh" and into, at minimum, some new intellectual abyss.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">How not to implement Neural Nets</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This code is something I did for an ML class. It implements a single hidden layer NN for character recognition from fundamental principles, but unless you really love math (I do) your time is probably better spent learning TF or TFJS. I've spent a lot of time since this project learning paths to packaging/deployment/distribution and making things production ready.</p>
