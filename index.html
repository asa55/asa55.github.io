          <h1>Welcome to yet another Page Dedicated to Unsolicited Contributions to the Open Source Community</h1>      
          <p>Hi, I'm late 20-something who always loved open source but never previously contributed. I've done <em>a lot</em> of scientific computing/signal processing/control systems/real-time data analysis, but I've been actively working on taking my algorithms and integrating them into larger ecosystems of code or exploring production-ready paths to distribution. Here you'll find a seemingly scattered set of projects, but the unifying theme is that these projects helped me explore many angles to deliver production-ready code for data science. See the <a href="https://github.com/asa55/asa55.github.io">source code for this site on my GitHub account</a>. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery; Bootstrap;</p>

        <h2>Projects (and Blog Posts (soon?))</h2>
        <p>We're all having fun right? I am an employee and an entrepreneur. I come from a control systems background (along with a math minor, a graduate thesis in machine learning, and a love for interesting systems of any kind). I built this site as a sandbox to play around with HTML/CSS/JS, then I realized how fun this is! I used jQuery and Bootstrap for the first rev (mainly because one of my good friends recommended it), but I would really like to mess around with frameworks of all kinds. In no particular order, I'll likely end up using this website as a basis to test and compare implementations using tools such as Angular / React / Tailwind CSS / Semantic UI / possibly live Flask and Django (if I can find a way to do this - I have a free tier AWS account so maybe there is a simple and free way to bake the WSGI and backend stuff into that and lean on github for the rest... Might look into these options this weekend). Check out some of the fun projects I've worked on in the past:</p>

                <p class="card-text">This code is something I did for an ML class. It implements a single hidden layer NN for character recognition from fundamental principles and works great, but unless you love math (I do) your might prefer to just start learning Keras with any backend (TF/Theano/CNTK). For those of you who dare to follow this link, you'll find my Matlab code hosted in GitHub, and the ReadMe.md will tell you how to use it and links you to a report I wrote on neural networks that dives deep into the inner workings of this code. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Matlab; Machine Learning; Neural Networks;</p>

                <p class="card-text">This app was the result of a suggestion from a friend. I am interested in exploring how to deploy web apps as native desktop apps using Electron. My friend suggested that I put together a simple app that can be used for the express purpose of testing this approach. The link will take you to a web app version of my calculator, and you can find the source code in my public GitHub repo. If you click this link, the calculator will display in your browser. You can find the source code on GitHub. Additionally, if you're interested, you can find detailed steps on how to deploy this app as a native desktop app for Mac/Linux/Windows in my CalculatorApp_DistributedUsingElectron repo. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery;</p>

                <p class="card-text">There is an awesome phenomenon in physics that enables you to calculate digits of pi via elastic collisions. This is inspired by "The Most Unexpected Answer to a Counting Puzzle" on YouTube by 3Blue1Brown, and thoroughly explores the phase space representation of the problem. QuickStart guide: click my link then when the next page fully loads click the "index.ipynb" file. You can explore the visualizations and simulations I wrote in Python and even experiment with the Python code directly (via your browser). <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Python; Project Jupyter; Binder; MarkDown; Simulation; Physics;</p>

It's not the most data efficient method <em> but </em> the fact that we can make desktop apps so easily is just awesome! I mean, this seems to open up a whole world for freelance developers or small development teams. If you click here and go to my project repo, you'll find a link in the readme that takes you to deployed versions of the calculator app (saved in my DropBox). Feel free to download the one for your OS and give the calculator a try!<br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery; Yarn; Electron</p>
