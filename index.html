        <h1>One Man's Unsolicited Thoughts and Opinions (Repository Edition)</h1>      
        <p>Hi, I'm late 20-something who always loved open source but never previously contributed. A few years into working as a full-time engineer, I realized that I'm more of the starving entrepreneur type at heart. Now, I'm doing everything I can to catalog my journey from scientific computing into production code. If you're like me (interested in just about everything but just want to make an honest living from home using software), reach out with questions/comments/concerns. We'll crack this code and document a clear path to success for others to follow.</p>

      <p>We're all having fun right? I am an employee and an entrepreneur. I come from a control systems background (among many other things) starting as an EE that migrated to ML (all the cool control kids are doing it), then realized the world of production software was my best path to getting out of the job I find to be "meh" and into, at minimum, some new intellectual abyss.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">How not to implement Neural Nets</h4>
          <p class="card-text">This code is something I did for an ML class. It implements a single hidden layer NN for character recognition from fundamental principles, but unless you really love math (I do) your time is probably better spent learning TF or TFJS. I've spent a lot of time since this project learning paths to packaging/deployment/distribution and making things production ready.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">The Most Basic App for Native Desktop with Electron</h4>
          <p class="card-text">This app was the result of a suggestion from a friend. I am interested in deploying web/native desktop/native mobile apps, and it was suggested that I put together a simple app that can be used for the express purpose of testing paths to get software out to the world. The link will take you t a web app verstion of my calculator, and you can find the source code in my public GitHub repos. The goal is to document how to take this web app and spin it as a native desktop app using Electron.</p>
