          <h1>Welcome to yet another Page Dedicated to Unsolicited Contributions to the Open Source Community</h1>      
          <p>Hi, I'm late 20-something who always loved open source but never previously contributed. I've done <em>a lot</em> of scientific computing/signal processing/control systems/real-time data analysis, but I've been actively working on taking my algorithms and integrating them into larger ecosystems of code or exploring production-ready paths to distribution. Here you'll find a seemingly scattered set of projects, but the unifying theme is that these projects helped me explore many angles to deliver production-ready code for data science. See the <a href="https://github.com/asa55/asa55.github.io">source code for this site on my GitHub account</a>. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery; Bootstrap;</p>

        <h2>Projects and Blog Posts (but mostly projects)</h2>
        <p>We're all having fun right? I am an employee and an entrepreneur. I come from a control systems background (along with a math minor, a graduate thesis in machine learning, and a love for interesting systems of any kind). Check out some of the fun projects I've worked on in the past:</p>

                <p class="card-text">This code is something I did for an ML class. It implements a single hidden layer NN for character recognition from fundamental principles and works great, but unless you love math (I do) your might prefer to just start learning Keras with any backend (TF/Theano/CNTK). For those of you who dare to follow this link, you'll find my Matlab code hosted in GitHub, and the ReadMe.md will tell you how to use it and links you to a report I wrote on neural networks that dives deep into the inner workings of this code. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Matlab; Machine Learning; Neural Networks;</p>

                <p class="card-text">This app was the result of a suggestion from a friend. I am interested in exploring how to deploy web apps as native desktop apps using Electron. My friend suggested that I put together a simple app that can be used for the express purpose of testing this approach. The link will take you to a web app version of my calculator, and you can find the source code in my public GitHub repo. If you click this link, the calculator will display in your browser. You can find the source code on GitHub. Additionally, if you're interested, you can find detailed steps on how to deploy this app as a native desktop app for Mac/Linux/Windows in my CalculatorApp_DistributedUsingElectron repo. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery;</p>

                <p class="card-text">There is an awesome phenomenon in physics that enables you to calculate digits of pi via elastic collisions. This is inspired by "The Most Unexpected Answer to a Counting Puzzle" on YouTube by 3Blue1Brown, and thoroughly explores the phase space representation of the problem. To get started with this, click my link then when the next page fully loads click the "index.ipynb" file. This will let you experiment with the Python code live. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Python; Project Jupyter; Binder; MarkDown; Simulation; Physics;</p>

                <p class="card-text">Learn how to modify the calculator web app from Part I for deployment as a native desktop application. It's not the most data efficient method <em> but </em> the fact that we can make desktop apps so easily is just awesome! I mean, this seems to open up a whole world for freelance developers or small development teams. If you click here and go yo my project repo, you'll find a link in the readme that takes you to deployed versions of the calculator app (saved in my DropBox). Feel free to download the one for your OS and give the calculator a try! Note that as of this moment I have tested on Windows and Linux, but my Mac OS deployment is not cooperating just yet. Fixing this is a TODO item.<br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery; Yarn; Electron</p>
