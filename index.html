      <h1>De-risking innovation</h1>
      <p>Innovation can be game-changing, but innovating in-house often risks too much time or money to confidently justify.
        <br><br>If only you knew exactly how long it would take, how much it would cost, and the projected ROI <em>beforehand</em>.
        <br><br>If only you could boil the risk down into a dollar amount, then the return on innovation would be simple to calculate and justify.
        <br><br>With my services, you can!
