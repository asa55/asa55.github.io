          <h1>Welcome to yet another Page Dedicated to Unsolicited Contributions to the Open Source Community</h1>      
          <p>Hi, I'm late 20-something who always loved open source but never previously contributed. A few years into working as a full-time engineer, I realized that I'm more of the starving entrepreneur type at heart. Now, I'm doing everything I can to catalog my journey from scientific computing into production code. If you're like me (interested in just about everything but just want to make an honest living from home using software), reach out with questions/comments/concerns. We'll crack this code and document a clear path to success for others to follow. See the source code for this site on my GitHub account. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery; Bootstrap;</p>

        <h2>Projects and Blog Posts (I may or may not be proud of)</h2>
        <p>We're all having fun right? I am an employee and an entrepreneur. I come from a control systems background (among many other things) starting as an EE that migrated to ML (all the cool control kids are doing it), then realized the world of production software was my best path to getting out of the job I find to be "meh" and into, at minimum, some new intellectual abyss.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This code is something I did for an ML class. It implements a single hidden layer NN for character recognition from fundamental principles and works great, but unless you love math (I do) your might prefer to just start learning Keras with any backend (TF/Theano/CNTK). For those of you who dare to follow this link, you'll find my Matlab code hosted in GitHub, and the ReadMe.md will tell you how to use it and links you to a report I wrote on neural networks that dives deep into the inner workings of this code. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Matlab; Machine Learning; Neural Networks;</p>

                <p class="card-text">This app was the result of a suggestion from a friend. I am interested in exploring how to deploy web apps as native desktop apps using Electron. My friend suggested that I put together a simple app that can be used for the express purpose of testing this approach. The link will take you to a web app verstion of my calculator, and you can find the source code in my public GitHub repo. For now, it is simply a much less functional calculator than you're used to but still fun. When I get around to deploying this as a desktop app, I'll detail the process thoroughly in the associated GitHub ReadMe.md. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> HTML; CSS; Javascript; jQuery;</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">Pi Falls from the Universe Yet Again</h4>
                <p class="card-text">There is an awesome phenomenon in physics that enables you to calculate digits of pi via elastic collisions. This simple simulation verifies this to be true, and my friend and I derived this analytically as well. Detailing our proof in this Notebook is an open TODO item, but there are existing proofs we point you to in the meantime. To get started with this, click my link then when the next page fully loads click the "index.ipynb" file. This will let you experiment with the Python code live. <br><br><b>Tags:</b> Python; Project Jupyter; Binder; MarkDown; Simulation; Physics;</p>
