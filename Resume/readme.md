# I intend to make my GitHub pages account more like an interactive resume
## Until recently, I didn't have a sound / coherent methodology driving the organizational scheme for my projects. I think this should do the trick, because in truth I am doing this as continued coding practice
## Full disclosure: as you can tell there is way too much stuff in here. I intend to hack away at different projects over time, probably blending concepts as I go. As for right now, I can't say I am satisfied that I have the best organizational scheme, and it is also tough to determine whether or not I'll actually be using this as a code repo or if I'll just use it to point to other code repos. Right now I believe I am in favor of the latter. I still think there is a lot of value in keeping this folder structure as-is, because it really helps organize topics of interest for me.
