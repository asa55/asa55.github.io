# I intend to make my GitHub pages account more like an interactive resume

## Until recently, I didn't have a sound / coherent methodology driving the organizational scheme for my projects. I think this should do the trick, because in truth I am doing this as continued coding practice

## It's nice to see that empty folders are automatically ignored. I have a lot of projects I'm interested in working on but you won't have to worry about navigating any clutter on my public repo
