## I'm particularly interested in 'full stack python' which is kind of a misnomer because you still need to have a good handle on JS in order to handle some of the frontend work. But both languages are widely used and also a lot of fun, so I'm highly motivated to master both. Here are a few of my notes:


|Topic| Python | both | JavaScript |
|-|-|:-:|-:|
| comments | #<br>`''' '''` | | //<br>/\* \*/ |
| declaration |my_var = 5| | var myVar=5<br>let myVar=5 <br>const myVar=5 |
| casting | str()<br>int()<br>float()<br>bool()| |String()<br>Number()<br>Boolean() |
| operators|// |+<br>-<br>\*<br>\*\*<br>/<br>% | |
| assignment| |+=<br>-=<br>\*=<br>\*\*=<br>/=<br>%= | |
|increment<br>decrement | | |++<br>\-\- |
|equality |is |==<br>!= |===<br>!== |
|string overloaded ops |\* |+ | |
| in |(value in sequence) | in |(index in array) |
| array data structure| (called a list but<br>implemented<br>as array) | [1,2,3] | (called an array) |
| indexing | `[1,2][0][0]` returns TypeError | `[1,2][0]` returns 1 |`[1,2][0][0]` returns undefined |
| immutable arrays | (1,2,3) called a tuple | |  (2,3) is syntactically valid but not useful |
| deletion | del(a) | | delete(a) |
| JSON-like syntax | `i,j='k',1`<br>`b={i:j}` returns hash table (dictionary) `{'k':1}`| | `i='k';j=1; b={i:j}` creates object `{i:'k',j:1}` |

### I have plenty more content to add, back at it again tomorrow!
