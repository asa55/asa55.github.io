## I'm in the middle of a refresh of this site... the following notes are to myself:

I have some updates to make regarding OOP and examples. I'm thinking it will be helpful to show implementations of data structures singly/doubly linked lists, max/min heaps, binary search trees and AVL trees, a few types of graphs, and possibly to highlight some of the environment differences given that JS is typically running in Node or a browser. I don't know if I'll show implementations of hashes, stacks, or queues because these are both built in to Python and JS. I'll consider throwing a few algorithms in as well - likely the most common comparison model and non-comparison model sorts, shortest path problems with Dijkstras algorithm and some variants, dynamic programming, the knapsack problem, maybe others
